## Installation

Please refer to [low-light-object-detection-detectron2](https://github.com/khurramHashmi/FeatEnHancer_ICCV/tree/main/low-light-object-detection-detectron2#readme) for installation requirements

## Datasets

### ExDark

Create a new folder named "exdark" in the "low-light-object-detection-detectron2/data" folder.
Create a new folder named "exdark" in the "low-light-object-detection-mmdetection/data" folder.

Download the [ExDark](https://github.com/cs-chan/Exclusively-Dark-Image-Dataset) dataset and copy the images into "low-light-object-detection-detectron2/data/exdark/images/" and "low-light-object-detection-mmdetection/data/exdark/images/" folders.


### DARK FACE

Create a new folder named "darkface" in the "low-light-object-detection-detectron2/data" folder.
Create a new folder named "darkface" in the "low-light-object-detection-mmdetection/data" folder.

Download the [DARK FACE](https://flyywh.github.io/CVPRW2019LowLight/) dataset and copy the images into "low-light-object-detection-detectron2/data/darkface/images/" and "low-light-object-detection-mmdetection/data/darkface/images/" folders.



## Train

To train the ExDark and DARK FACE using FeatEnHancer based Featurized Query R-CNN run the following commands:
The training utilizes 2 GPU's

```
sh low-light-object-detection-detectron2/train_exdark.sh
sh low-light-object-detection-detectron2/train_darkface.sh
```

To train the ExDark and DARK FACE using FeatEnHancer based RetinaNet run the following commands:
The training utilizes 6 GPU's

```
sh low-light-object-detection-mmdetection/exec_script_exdark.sh
sh low-light-object-detection-mmdetection/exec_script_darkface.sh
```


## Results and Checkpoints

### ExDark

| Model                                 | mAP | Config |  
|:--------------------------------------|  :---:  |:---:  |
| FeatEnHancer + Featurized Query R-CNN | 86.3 | [config](low-light-object-detection-detectron2/configs/exdark_config.yaml) | 
### DARK FACE

| Model    | mAP | Config | 
| :---     |  :---:  |:---:  |
| FeatEnHancer + Featurized Query R-CNN | 69.0 | [config](low-light-object-detection-detectron2/configs/darkface_config.yaml) | 



### Reproducing Results on Other Downstream Vision Tasks:
* The models developed for other downstream tasks, such as Semantic Segmentation and Video Object Detection, utilize distinct frameworks (MMDet, MMSeg, and MMTracking). Hence, it was not possible to release a unified repository at this time. However, to facilitate reproducibility of results, the same [FeatEnHancer script](low-light-object-detection-detectron2/queryrcnn/featenhancer/feat_enhancer.py) can be employed across these different tasks.
